Spam news detection
This project aims to detect and classify fake or spam news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. It takes in a dataset of news headlines/articles and identifies whether the news is real or fake based on its content.

🔍 Features
Preprocessing of text data (cleaning, stopword removal, lemmatization)

Feature extraction using TF-IDF Vectorization

Classification using Multinomial Naive Bayes

Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

Simple, readable code for beginners to understand fake news detection

📁 Tech Stack
Python 🐍

Pandas

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

Scikit-learn (sklearn)

🚀 How it works
Load and combine real and fake news datasets

Clean and preprocess the text data

Convert text to numerical features using TF-IDF

Train a Naive Bayes classifier

Predict and evaluate the results

✅ Output
Detects whether a news headline or article is fake or real

Evaluation report and accuracy score

📌 Use Case
